Python basics
==============

As we work through the basics of Python in class, we'll also ask you to complete several corresponding assignments on Codecademy designed to reinforce basic syntax of the language.

The best way to turn in this assignment will be to create a new folder in the Github repository you're using for your assignments (or create a new repository). For each section you complete, take a screenshot of the [Python lesson index page](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) showing that each section has been completed, like this:

Put that image in the folder and check it in.

Lessons to complete
-------------------

The first step is to sign up for a [Codecademy account](https://www.codecademy.com/learn), which is free! Once that's done, you'll start working your way through the lessons, beginning with section one (Python Syntax) and ending with section eight (Loops).

Each of these lessons should take about 10 or 15 minutes and should be completed in sequential order.

As you work through the lessons, you'll also see some of them are marked as "Pro." These are for paid Codecademy users and you can feel free to ignore them.

A couple notes
--------------

These exercises will move in a slightly different order than the things we cover in class, and they will cover some material we only touch on lightly in the class. If you have questions as you run into some of those sections, feel free to ask. But working through those will round out your skills and make things a bit easier later this semester.

Other than your questions, we probably won't talk much about these exercises during class. Codecademy does a pretty good job of explaining things as you go!

Deadlines
---------

You can complete these exercises at your own pace, but please check your screenshots into your Github repo by **Wednesday, Oct. 10**. Doesn't matter to me whether you check them in as you go or just do it all at once.
